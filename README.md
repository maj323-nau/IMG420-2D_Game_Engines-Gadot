# IMG420-2D_Game_Engines-Gadot
This is my project 4 assignment which is an addition into assignment 1.

Assets found here.

https://brackeysgames.itch.io/brackeys-platformer-bundle

You will notice that I have implemented 
-A TileSet and a Tile Map
-Sprite Animations
-A Player Character and movement
-Gravity
-Enemy movement
-Collisions
-Collectibles
-UI Progress Bar (for collecting coins, far right side of map)


Additions to this assignment (eventually) include:
-C# programming instead of GDscript
-Particle Effects on the coins

My demo is called 4 Coins. The point of the game is to reach the end and have four coins.
You play in a platformer style game as a knight. 
Controlled with the arrow keys and space bar, your powers are nearly infinite.
You must hop onto platformers, dodge one enemy NPC slime and explore until you find... the four coins.

**To the TA**
I am turning in what I have now at 9pm 10/21/2025, tomorrow (10/22/2025) I plan to have my C# programming fully implemented as well as a goal to put particle effects on the coins.
