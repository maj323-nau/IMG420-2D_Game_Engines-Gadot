# IMG420-2D_Game_Engines-Gadot
This is my student repo. regarding any products or assignment results for my IMG420 class at NAU

My first game is super simple.
It was made in Gadot using assets I found online for free.
The assets are here...

My demo is called 4 Coins. The point of the game is to reach the end and have four coins.
You play in a platformer style game as a knight. 
Controlled with the arrow keys and space bar, your powers are nearly infinite.
You must hop onto platformers, dodge one enemy NPC slime and explore until you find... the four coins.

I am very proud of the fact I got animated sprites and NPCs to interact with the player.

Next to come will be enhanced movement and sound elements.
